# RealEstateFinance

Goal: structure your deal to the best possible way (how much equity to put to get required DCF needed for other investments). Cost of opportunity.

1. Create an automated script for DCF valuation. Inputs should be given (i.e. Excel file from Break into CRE).
   - All details of the deal to be enter, purchase price, notary cost, rent, rent growth, capex, etc
   - Client gives input on how much equity/debt he intends to put, and it which interest rate
   - Client gives future financial objectives to see determine the optimal debt/equity to allocate 
2. Look at competitors (e.g. cash flow frog)
3. Create sensitivity analysis to see the range how outputs that can happen (and stress testing, cf. CRE ST)
4. Create automated Excel and PPT
5. Compare actual results to first plan. Readjust with new scenarios.
